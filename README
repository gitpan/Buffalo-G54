NAME
    Buffalo::G54 - Limited scraping API for Buffalo WBR2-G54 routers

SYNOPSIS
        use Buffalo::G54;

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a limited API to control a Buffalo WBR2-G54
    router by scraping its Web interface.

  METHODS
    Currently, only the following methods are implemented:

    "my $buf = Buffalo::G54->new()"
        Constructor.

    "$buf->connect(...)"
        Connects to the router's Web interface, takes the following key
        value pairs:

            ip       => "192.168.0.1",
            user     => "root",
            password => "topsecret!",

        Returns 1 if the router's Web interface responded properly, and
        "undef" otherwise.

    "$buf->version()"
        Ask the router for the version of its firmware. Returns something
        like "WBR2-G54 Ver.2.21" if successful, or "undef" on failure.

            http://192.168.0.1/advance/advance-admin-system.htm

    "$buf->reboot()"
        Reboot the router.

    "$buf->wireless($status)"
        Switch the router's wireless network on or off -- or query its
        status.

        To query the status of the router's wireless network, call
        "wireless()" without parameters:

              # Returns "on" or "off"
            my $status = $buf->wireless();

        It will return "on" or "off", or "undef" if an error occurred.

              # Switch wireless off if it's on
            if($buf->wireless() eq "on") {
                $buf->wireless("off");
            }

        To switch the wireless network on or off, pass a $status value of
        "on" or "off" to the "wireless()" method.

        Note that switching the wireless network on and off requires having
        set up the wireless network in the first place. "wireless()" is just
        going to toggle the on/off switch, it doesn't configure the SSID,
        encryption and other important settings.
